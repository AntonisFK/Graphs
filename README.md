#Graphs Class 
The class keeps track of how may edges are represented in a graph, as well as the number of vertices by utilizing an array whose length is equal
to the number of vertices in the graph. In each element of the array, the for loop adds a sub array to store all the *adjacent vertices* . 

##What is a Graph 
Graph consist of a set of vertices and set of edges. Think of a map each town is a vertices and a road that connects them is an Edge.
[A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))

**Edges** defined as a pair(v1, v2) where v1 and v2 are two vertices in a graph
